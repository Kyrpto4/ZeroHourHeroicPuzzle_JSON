# ZeroHourHeroicPuzzle_JSON

I had created this as a way to practice writing Java as well as introducing myself to utilizing JSON.

The reason I chose a tool for Destiny 2 was because there were webapps out there but none of them seemed to function for me.

This took roughly a week to decide the logic (then scrapped and rewritten twice) and build the methods and classes.

This is also partially designed off of a Magic: The Gathering database I was originally working on from scratch as well.

Pull in to your choice of IDE, export as an executable .jar file, run.

Credit for the combination tables is written in the code, however will not display to the user.
